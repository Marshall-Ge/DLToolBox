This is also super easy to use (just follow instructions). I can see already that I will begin expanding the time between visits which will definitely help me save money in the long run.

I am always in the market to use products that can help extend my salon visits. This Keratin shampoo is really nice. It is sulfate free (which is the first thing I look for ) and makes my hair feel silky smooth and soft. I highly recommend for anyone who wants to improve the texture and appearance of your hair.
